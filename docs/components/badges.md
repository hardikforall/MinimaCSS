# Badges

MinimaCSS provides a versatile set of badge components, used for adding small count and labeling elements. Badges are typically used to display a small amount of information like a count near another element or to tag elements with a small categorization label.

## Usage

Badges in MinimaCSS come in various styles, including Filled and outline, and they can be further styled with the `badge-pill` class to make them rounded. The following sections illustrate the different badge styles available in MinimaCSS.

## Filled Badges

Filled badges have a solid background color and are used to draw attention to the information they contain. They come in different colors to represent different types of information.

```html
<span class="badge badge-primary">Primary</span>
<span class="badge badge-secondary">Secondary</span>
<span class="badge badge-success">Success</span>
<span class="badge badge-danger">Danger</span>
<span class="badge badge-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="badge badge-info">Info</span>
<span class="badge badge-light">Light</span>
<span class="badge badge-dark">Dark</span>
```

<div class="component-preview">
    <span class="badge badge-primary">Primary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">Secondary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-success">Success</span>
    <span class="badge badge-danger">Danger</span>
    <span class="badge badge-warning">Warning</span>
    <span class="badge badge-info">Info</span>
    <span class="badge badge-light">Light</span>
    <span class="badge badge-dark">Dark</span>
</div>

## Outline Badges

Outline badges have a transparent background and a colored border. They are used to display information without drawing too much attention.

```html
<span class="badge badge-outline-primary">Primary</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-secondary ">Secondary</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-success">Success</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-danger">Danger</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-info">Info</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-light">Light</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-dark">Dark</span>
```

<div class="component-preview">
    <span class="badge badge-outline-primary">Primary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-secondary">Secondary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-success">Success</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-danger">Danger</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-warning">Warning</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-info">Info</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-light">Light</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-dark">Dark</span>
</div>

## Filled Pill Badges

Filled rounded badges have a solid background color and rounded corners. They are used for the same purpose as filled badges, but with a softer visual style.

```html
<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill">Primary</span>
<span class="badge badge-secondary badge-pill">Secondary</span>
<span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">Success</span>
<span class="badge badge-danger badge-pill">Danger</span>
<span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill">Warning</span>
<span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">Info</span>
<span class="badge badge-light badge-pill">Light</span>
<span class="badge badge-dark badge-pill">Dark</span>
```

<div class="component-preview">
    <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill">Primary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-secondary badge-pill">Secondary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-success badge-pill">Success</span>
    <span class="badge badge-danger badge-pill">Danger</span>
    <span class="badge badge-warning badge-pill">Warning</span>
    <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">Info</span>
    <span class="badge badge-light badge-pill">Light</span>
    <span class="badge badge-dark badge-pill">Dark</span>
</div>

## Outline Pill Badges

Outline rounded badges have a transparent background, a colored border, and rounded corners. They are used for the same purpose as outline badges, but with a softer visual style.

```html
<span class="badge badge-outline-primary badge-pill">Primary</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-secondary badge-pill">Secondary</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-success badge-pill">Success</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-danger badge-pill">Danger</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-warning badge-pill">Warning</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-info badge-pill">Info</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-light badge-pill">Light</span>
<span class="badge badge-outline-dark badge-pill">Dark</span>
```

<div class="component-preview">
    <span class="badge badge-outline-primary badge-pill">Primary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-secondary badge-pill">Secondary</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-success badge-pill">Success</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-danger badge-pill">Danger</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-warning badge-pill">Warning</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-info badge-pill">Info</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-light badge-pill">Light</span>
    <span class="badge badge-outline-dark badge-pill">Dark</span>
