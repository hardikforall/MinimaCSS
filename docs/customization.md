# MinimaCSS - Customization Guide

## Introduction

MinimaCSS is built with customization in mind, allowing you to tailor the framework to fit the unique needs of your project. This guide provides an overview of how to customize MinimaCSS, including modifying variables, creating custom classes, and overriding default styles.

## Customizing SCSS Variables

MinimaCSS uses SCSS, which allows you to customize the framework by adjusting variables. You can change colors, fonts, spacing, and other properties by modifying these variables.

#### Steps for Customization:

1. **Clone or Fork MinimaCSS Repository**: Begin by cloning or forking the MinimaCSS repository to have your own local copy.

2. **Modify SCSS Variables**: Navigate to the SCSS files and locate the variables file (usually `_variables.scss`). Here, you can change values for colors, font sizes, margins, paddings, etc., to match your design requirements.

3. **Recompile SCSS**: After modifying the variables, recompile the SCSS to generate a new CSS file that reflects your changes.

4. **Replace the Default CSS**: Use your newly generated CSS file in your project to replace the default MinimaCSS styles.

## Creating Custom Classes

If you need styles that aren't provided out of the box, you can create custom classes.

1. **Add New SCSS File**: Create a new SCSS file for your custom styles.

2. **Write Custom Styles**: Define your custom classes in this file. You can use existing variables and mixins from MinimaCSS to maintain consistency with the framework's design.

3. **Import Custom SCSS File**: Import your custom SCSS file into the main stylesheet, ensuring it's compiled into the final CSS.

## Overriding Default Styles

You can override default styles by writing custom CSS rules with a higher specificity than the framework's styles.

1. **Create a Custom CSS File**: Make a new CSS file for your overrides.

2. **Write Overrides**: Add your custom CSS rules here. Ensure that your selectors are specific enough to override the default styles.

3. **Include After MinimaCSS Styles**: Link this CSS file in your HTML after the MinimaCSS stylesheet to ensure that your overrides take precedence.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Changes Manageable**: Make incremental changes and test frequently to ensure that your customizations don't break the layout or design.
- **Document Your Customizations**: Keep a record of changes made for future reference, especially if working in a team.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep track of updates to MinimaCSS to ensure compatibility with your customizations.

## Conclusion

Customizing MinimaCSS can significantly enhance the look and feel of your web project. By following this guide, you can ensure that your customizations are effective, maintainable, and seamlessly integrated with the core framework.
