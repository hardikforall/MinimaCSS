# MinimaCSS - Troubleshooting Guide

## Introduction

Troubleshooting is an essential part of working with any CSS framework. This guide addresses common issues you might encounter while using MinimaCSS and provides solutions to help you resolve them effectively.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Styles Not Applied Correctly

**Problem**: Your styles don't appear as expected, or changes made to the SCSS files are not reflected.

**Solutions**:

- **Check CSS Linking**: Ensure the MinimaCSS stylesheet is correctly linked in your HTML file.
- **SCSS Compilation**: If you're modifying SCSS, ensure that it is being compiled correctly into CSS.
- **Class Name Conflicts**: Check for any naming conflicts with MinimaCSS classes and your custom classes.
- **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache to ensure it's not loading an outdated stylesheet.

### 2. Responsive Design Issues

**Problem**: The layout breaks or doesn't appear responsive on different devices.

**Solutions**:

- **Meta Tag**: Ensure you have the responsive viewport meta tag in your HTML `<head>`: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`.
- **Media Queries**: Check your media queries in custom CSS to ensure they are set up correctly.
- **Container Usage**: Use MinimaCSS's container classes correctly to ensure responsive behavior.

### 3. JavaScript Components Not Working

**Problem**: JavaScript-based components (like modals or accordions) are not functioning.

**Solutions**:

- **JavaScript Integration**: Ensure that you have correctly integrated the JavaScript necessary for these components.
- **Correct Initialization**: Some components may require initialization scripts; check the documentation for specific instructions.
- **Conflict with Other Scripts**: Look for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries or scripts in your project.

### 4. Customization Conflicts

**Problem**: Custom styles are not taking precedence over MinimaCSS's default styles.

**Solutions**:

- **Specificity of Selectors**: Increase the specificity of your custom CSS selectors.
- **Order of Stylesheets**: Ensure your custom stylesheet is linked after the MinimaCSS stylesheet.
- **!important Flag**: Use the `!important` flag sparingly to override specific styles.

## Best Practices for Troubleshooting

- **Isolate the Problem**: Narrow down the issue to a specific component or style rule.
- **Use Developer Tools**: Utilize browser developer tools to inspect elements and debug CSS.
- **Consult Documentation**: Refer to MinimaCSS documentation for guidance and clarification.
- **Seek Community Help**: If the issue persists, consider seeking help from the MinimaCSS community or forums.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting in MinimaCSS, like any other framework, involves a systematic approach to identify and solve issues. With the right tools and methods, most problems can be resolved efficiently, allowing you to build robust and visually appealing web interfaces.
